<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This grilled wing recipe is always a hit! I grill them up before a party and keep them hot in a low oven. I always use Frank's RedHot sauce. It's got lots of flavor and isn't too spicy.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<h4>Chicken wing</h4>
    <li>3 pounds chicken wings, cut apart at joints, wing tips discard</li>	
    <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>        
    <li>½ cup Italian-style salad dressing</li>
<h4>Sauce</h4>            
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>¼ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®), or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
</ul>

<h3>Step</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare wings: Combine chicken wings, soy sauce, and Italian dressing in a large resealable plastic bag; coat chicken wings with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight. </li>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
    <li>Prepare sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in hot pepper sauce and soy sauce until combined. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken wings from marinade and pat dry; discard any remaining marinade. Cook on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until chicken is browned and no longer pink, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place grilled wings in a large bowl. Pour butter sauce over wings; toss until well-coated.</li>
</ol>
